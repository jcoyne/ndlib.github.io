# Waxing Philosophical (or a Life's Inventory?)

Throughout my life, I learned about being agile.

I played lots of games (my top four are listed here):

- Magic the Gathering
- Settlers of Catan
- Dungeons and Dragons (and other role-playing games)
- Tichu

I had a family. I volunteered. I attended meetups. I wrote and maintained software. I went to college. I took logic classes in elementary school during the summer. I journaled. I read a lot.

It seems everything I do and have done is geared towards improving my mental agility.

Early in my software development career, I learned a lot about structure and structuring.

There were data structures:

- Linked list
- Stacks
- Queues

There was code file structures:

- Public methods at the top of the file
- Private methods at the bottom
- Initializers as the first method of the class

There was database structures:

- Data normalization
- Entity relationship diagrams for database tables
- Data dictionaries
- [Primary, Foreign, Surrogate, Alternate keys](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/keys.html)

Agile methodologies I've experienced are myopic cherry pickings from the processes that are the side-effects of Agile principles in action.

I dislike the agile methodology because I have not seen it implemented well. And as I reflect on that methodology, I realize it is not agile. What I have seen is in fact a cherry picking of the processes that were a side-effect of cleaving to Agile principles.

First, I have not had direct and regular access to customers. They are busy dealing with the operations of serving their customers. They are used to software deliveries that are on a geological timescale. They meet with other team members and grow the requirements.

Second, the majority of the organization of stories is nightmarish. High level impressions mixed with abstract features, concrete behavior, and specific tasks. It is hard to discern the underlying requirements from this scatter shot approach.

Stories are recorded early, perhaps before a solid understanding of the problem has emerged. They are recorded in an issue tracker which begins to feel like an oft ignored suggestion box.

Third, getting started on an application in Rails is very easy for me. So easy that I can belt out lots of "working" code in a short period of time.

I dislike the Agile Methodology as I have experienced it. And I'm exploring why:

- Customers are hard to bring to the table
- I dislike writing user stories
- I dislike getting something out the door prematurely

Consider the Agile Methodology's advice of delivering something working early. Once the software is deployed there is a commitment to keeping things working.

This is fine, if you have an idea of where things are going.

_What should I ship?_

Our first feature. A stable "hello world" application?

_How did we determine our first feature?_

Its the most important feature.

_How did we know its the most important feature?_

Because we talked with the customer.

I dislike writing user stories

- They get written too early
- They vary in levels of abstractions

Why do I dislike them?

Because we want to get something out the door quick. Which means

I dislike the compulsion to ship something quickly; Its as though getting something out the door is the most important thing.

But at its core, its the hurried nature of how I have seen Agile manifest.

Always sprinting, never resting.

I have not seen a commitment to the agile principles And hear is why.

User Stories are terrible because:

- They are written too early in the discovery process
- They vary wildly in the level of abstraction -

I loathe writing user stories early on; Because we are so early in the process of exploring the problem, that putting down actionable user stories is folly.

# Anecdotes

Every time I have serialized hash data into a database, I have regretted it. It felt like I was doing something Agile - making a quick determination and moving on - but I was in fact committing to a Structure (noun) that would become hard to change.

## I hate writing Stories, until I don't, then I love writing them.
